    <td>I mainly watched my teacher's examples on the board and copied them to grasp the knowledge that needed to be learned. I paid attention and didnâ€™t distract myself.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I found it quite hard to go as fast as the teacher and so I had to rely on my peers to catch up. I could type faster to prevent this from reoccurring.</td>

    <td>The excessive amounts of talking led to a class detention on Monday and I was part of the problem. I will not talk as much as I did in the future to benefit my learning.</td>
