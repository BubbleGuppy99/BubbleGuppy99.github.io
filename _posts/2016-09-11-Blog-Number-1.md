(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>

  <tr>
    <td>The first set of instructions went well, although I managed to get confused when the program showed up a slightly different version of the information and I got distracted by menus that weren't relevant.  

I also got confused with Gabriel and how to use it. I need to be aware of the task at hand next time I come to work and when working give it my all.
