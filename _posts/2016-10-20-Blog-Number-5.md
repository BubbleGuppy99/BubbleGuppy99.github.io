    <td>Mainly by focused listening and watching a demonstration by Mr Tansley. I noted everything down mentally and went carefully among the steps. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I found that keeping up with everything was quite hard and needed to pay attention to the task at hand. I also found it hard to remember everything and hence why I didn't reach my target. I also spent time on my blog instead of the sheets.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will make sure I use more time  on the sheets rather than my blog no matter what so I get everything done correctly. I will ask more questions as well just to be sure and try and get help from my peers. I will also not get distracted and try to persevere.</td>
